This version of raspbian only came with Java 11, which is 
not supported on the Zero. Therefore 8 had to be installed:

sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre-headless openjdk-8-jre

After that, I had to switch to Java 8 by:

sudo update-alternatives --config java



Setup in Netbeans on MacOS
---------------------
Notice that install folder in the FrankieZero remote profile is "/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-armhf/"

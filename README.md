# Overview
Frankie is a Raspberry Pi with several sensors. It logs the sensor data and uploads it to a server using a custom RESTful API.

The PythonProject and the NetbeansProject are two ways of doing the same thing. I first implemented the system in Python, but then I wanted to try developing in Java on the Raspberry Pi, so I started creating the same functionality in Java.

Currently, the PythonProject is working, and the NetbeansProject is under development.
